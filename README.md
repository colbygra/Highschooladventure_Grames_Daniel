python story

This was coded for and works on repl.it. It should work on other programs but who knows code is weird sometimes. 

Uses imports: time, colorama, and sys. The program will not work properly without these packages. 

repl.it will sometimes print text from functions incorrectly resulting in missing text and or text being printed out of order. We havent found the same issue with IDLE.
